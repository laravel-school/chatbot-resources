## Some random ideas: 

- Bug detection and suggestion\
  There are some applications e.g. [sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) that provide error detection for your application.
  But it does not suggest any automatic suggestion.

  âœ… So, there could be a market where you can offer some suggestions based on the error detected. Maybe using some AI help!
  One possible example could be [github co-pilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
  Happy to discuss this further ðŸ˜Š.
